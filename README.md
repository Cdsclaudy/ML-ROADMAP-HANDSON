# ML-ROADMAP-HANDSON
## By Claudius D'Souza

- This respository focuses on adding to the concepts mentioned in [i.am.ai](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#machine-learning-roadmap) and giving a more practical view to these applications.
- Most of the information used in this repository will be in reference to sources online that will be clearly mentioned in each document.
- The repository will be updated on a frequent basis and extra content will be appended on each iteration.
- In case of any issues, please feel free to reach out to me at claudiusjdsouza@gmail.com
